# Mugilan's Dotfiles

## Needs Work

1. Still need to be tested
1. No idea it will work
1. Setup Iterm2 first by downloading it directly from website.

```zsh
sudo softwareupdate -i -a
xcode-select --install
git clone git@github.com:Mugilan-Codes/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
chmod +x fresh.sh
```

### Plan

1. Do Software update (possibly through command line).
1. Downlod Xcode Command line Tools. (also Xcode if needed).
1. Git Configuration and SSH
1. Clone the Dotfiles repo in ~/.dotfiles.
1. Install Oh-My-Zsh.

### TODO

1. Generate and copy SSH keys for github
